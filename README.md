# PureData

This repository contains some [PureData](http://puredata.info) work I have done.

The directory structure is:
- **patches**: the main thing.
- **tests**: some tests I do in order to check that my patches work as I want.
- **work**: some music built with my patches, not really serious. Most could be considered as tests, actually.
